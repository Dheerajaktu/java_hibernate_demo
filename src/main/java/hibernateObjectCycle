# Hibernate Object life cycle(HOLC)
>> there are total 4 states in HOLC 
1 - Transient State
2 - Persistant State
3 - Detached State
4 - Remove State

1 - Transient States(TS) -
    --> whenever we set new properties to an object then it goes in Transient State. 
        so in TS object is not associated with DB and Session.
2&3 - Persistent State and Detached State
   ---> When we use save()/persist()/saveUpdate() then our object gets into Session and as well as it also change into DB
        means in this state both(Session and DB) has data 
        so we when we're in persistent state then we have two option --
        
        A): We can clear/close session then it will go in Detached state that means we remove object from Session but not from DB.
        B): In the PS we can delete object from DB also but data would remain in session so we can fetch also from Session as per need.
         
4 -  If we are in PS and then if we delete object from DB but object remains in Session so that means we are in Remove State.
